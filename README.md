# Loan_Prediction_with_SVM

• This project involves predicting loan approval status using a dataset containing various features of loan applicants. 
• The dataset, which includes attributes such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and personal details, was preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables. 
• The features were encoded numerically, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was employed to train the model on the training data and make predictions on the test set. 
• The project's goal is to accurately classify whether a loan application will be approved or not, leveraging machine learning techniques to assist in decision-making processes for loan approvals.
